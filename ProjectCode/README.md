The project consists of two main code files: Naco_datasets.ipynb and Naco_ensembles.ipynb.

Naco_datasets.ipynb contains the creation of the three datasets. Furthermore it performs the tests of all the individual classifier on these tests.

Naco_ensemblse.ipynb contains the same three datasets and performs the quantitative tests on all of the ensembles mentioned in our report.

To run the code one must first unzip the creditcard.zip file and place the creditcard.csv file in the same folder as the python notebooks. Once that is completed the code can be ran.
